            The Founding (1924).
The school was constructed on forty acres of donated estate land, intended to serve as a "center for cultivation" for the growing community. 
The primary structure, characterized by its prominent white stone columns and symmetrical brick wings, was built to provide a collegiate atmosphere that inspired discipline and higher learning.
            </p>
        <p>
    While the school was initially known simply by its geographic location, the Red Fox was formally adopted as the official mascot in 1954. 
    The choice was inspired by the indigenous foxes that inhabited the dense forest bordering the athletic fields. 
    The animal was selected to represent the qualities of keen intelligence, resilience, and adaptability—traits the faculty sought to instill in every graduate.            
        </p>
             <p>
 The iconic central portico, featuring four grand pillars,
 serves as the ceremonial heart of the campus. Over the decades, 
 the "Garden City" identity has been maintained through the preservation of the original groves,
 ensuring that the school remains a quiet sanctuary for study and athletic pursuit.
